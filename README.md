## Steps Performed

### 1. Selection of VPN
- Chose **iTop VPN** (free version) as the VPN client for this task.
- Created an account to access the service.

### 2. Installation

### 3. VPN Connection
- Connected to a VPN server located in **Miami, United States (Server #5028)**.
- The app confirmed successful connection.

### 4. Verification of IP Address Change
- Before VPN:  
  Public IP → `49.204.25.34` (Hyderabad, India).  
- After VPN:  
  Public IP → `5.34.179.92` (Miami, United States).  
- Confirmed IP masking and location change using **whatismyipaddress.com**.

### 5. Browsing Test

## VPN Encryption & Privacy Features

### Encryption
- iTop VPN uses **OpenVPN (TCP/UDP)** and **HTTPS** tunneling.  
- Advertised as **“military-grade encryption”**, generally implying AES-256 standard.  

### Privacy
- Claims a **no-logs policy** (does not record browsing history, DNS queries, or IP addresses).  
- Includes **Kill Switch** to prevent IP leaks if VPN disconnects unexpectedly.  
- **Split Tunneling** available in premium version (route only selected apps through VPN).  
- Headquarters: **Hong Kong (China)**, outside of Five/Nine/13 Eyes alliances, but not independently audited.

## Benefits of VPN
- Hides real IP and masks online location.  
- Encrypts all internet traffic to prevent interception.  
- Protects users on public Wi-Fi from attackers.  
- Bypasses geo-restrictions and censorship.  
- Provides a layer of anonymity for browsing.  

## Limitations of VPN
- Free version has speed and server limitations.  
- Browsing may be slower due to encryption overhead.  
- Some websites can detect and block VPN traffic.  
- No independent audits to verify privacy claims.  
- VPN does not stop tracking via cookies or browser fingerprinting.

## Conclusion
The VPN task was successful. iTop VPN masked the original IP (India) and routed traffic through Miami, USA. This demonstrated how VPNs secure browsing with encryption, protect privacy, and bypass restrictions, while also highlighting the trade-offs and risks of using free VPN services.
